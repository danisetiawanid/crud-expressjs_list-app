# Creating a simple CRUD project from PROGATE Course with Express JS and MySql database

Step-by-step guide to create a database with a table and run the project:

1. Open your preferred database management tool and connect to the database server.
2. Create a new database with the name `list_app`.
3. Inside the `list_app` database, create a new table named `items`.
4. Add two columns to the `items` table: `ID` and `NAME`.
5. Set the `ID` column as the primary key and enable auto-increment to automatically generate a unique value for each new record.
6. Set the `NAME` column as a `varchar` data type to store text values.
7. Save the changes to the table and exit the database management tool.
8. Open your project in a code editor or IDE.
9. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory.
10. Run the command `npm start` to start the project.
